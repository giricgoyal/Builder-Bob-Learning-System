You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have rightly placed the sandbags at a medium elevation area 
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a low population area, these sandbags would be inefficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 0

Note: You could place this sandbag more down the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have rightly placed the sandbags at a medium elevation area 
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a low population area, these sandbags would be inefficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 0

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have rightly placed the sandbags at a medium elevation area 
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a low population area, these sandbags would be inefficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 0

Note: You could place this sandbag more down the river

TOTAL SCORE: 15

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have rightly placed the sandbags at a medium elevation area 
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a low population area, these sandbags would be inefficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 0

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

TOTAL SCORE: 20

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this sandbag more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a medium population area, these sandbags would be partly efficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
