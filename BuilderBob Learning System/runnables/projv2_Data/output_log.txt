EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have rightly placed the levee at a low elevation area 
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
You have rightly placed the levee at a high economy area, this levee would be very efficient for economic security. Since the economy now can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have rightly placed the levee at a high population area, this levee would very efficient. Since more number of lives can be protected the levee now
SCORE: 10

Note: You could place this levee more up the river

EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have placed the sandbags at a low elevation area, but they must to be placed at a medium elevation area in order for it to be effective since their hight is limited, they need to be bolstered by natural land elevation
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 5

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have placed the sandbags at a low population area, these sandbags would be inefficient. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high population, since more number of lives can be protected the sandbags then
