EVALUATION OF TOPOLOGICAL MEASURES :
You have rightly placed the levee at a low elevation area 
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
You have rightly placed the levee at a high economy area, this levee would be very efficient for economic security. Since the economy now can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF POPULATION SECURITY :
You have rightly placed the levee at a high population area, this levee would very efficient. Since more number of lives can be protected the levee now
SCORE: 10

EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC SECURITY :
The sandbags is placed in a medium economy area, these sandbags would partly efficient for economic security. A sandbags would be better placed at an area with high economy, since the economy then can be protected from the destruction caused by floods
